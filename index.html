            Hi! <br />
            <br />
            My name is Jess. I am currently a Software Engineer student at
            TripleTen. Prior to my time at TripleTen, I worked in Aviation for
            about 2 and a half years. My time in Aviation was invaluable, but
            ultimately, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career that would
            further allow me to utilize my attention to detail, combined with
            added aspects of creativity and building that a career in Aviation
            wasn't able to provide.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, I hold passions for rock climbing, travelling,
            singing, immersing myself in film, writing poetry, and - last but
            not least - spending time with loved ones. I was born and raised in
            Hong Kong, but come from a diverse family background. I have lived
            in Cincinnati, OH, since 2016. In the time I've been here,
            Cincinnati has become my new home.
            <br />
            <br />
            As much as I love Cincinnati, a dream of mine is to explore more
            that the United States has to offer. And I want to do so by spending
            a few years moving from state-to-state; getting to experience the
            vastness of culture and nature our country has to offer. Which is
            why pursuing remote career opportunities is really important to me.
